Starboard is a scoreboard, designed by Ascend, meant for professional Starcraft 2 broadcasting. Features player name, color, race, and score displays with a subbar showing optional stream/match information.

**Coding Style**

Main development is done with Visual Studio 2010 (Express should be supported due to no cross-language necessity). Documentation style is done compliant to StyleCop and overall style uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) constructs.

As-is, the application runs as a single executable, no installation required, and has a requirement of .NET 4.0 Client Profile, available as a free download from Microsoft.
